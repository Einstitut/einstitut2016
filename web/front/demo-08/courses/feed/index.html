				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="videoWrapper" itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0pjVcIsU6A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<h2>What’s Best for Node.js Moving Forward</h2>
<p>The Node.js Advisory Board made recommendations on issues such as project governance, code of conduct, intellectual property, API compatibility testing, developer training, community representation and website management that have been extremely valuable to the project. It became clear that we could address the needs of the Node.js project and its diverse ecosystem more effectively via a neutral Foundation — one that will bring in additional resources, grow the Node.js contributor base and foster a healthy ecosystem of product and service providers.</p>
<p>We have taken the recommendations of the Advisory Board and started implementing them in the Node.js project. As the project moves into the Foundation, we will add even more transparency and open the governance model even further to ensure it is driven by the community. We will establish a Board of Directors that handles business issues such as legal, finance, fundraising, and community development. We will also evolve the existing Node.js core team into a Technical Committee staffed by core committers. The TC will run autonomously and drive all technical decisions on the project.</p>
<h2>Focusing on Our Community</h2>
<p>So far, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Fidelity and SAP have joined us as founding members, and we&#8217;ll continue to add others over the coming months. We want the project to represent the diverse interests and perspectives of the community at large and are committed to including organizations of all sizes and individuals. In our efforts to open the Foundation to everyone, we will provide scaled sponsorship levels to make participation possible at any budget.</p>
<p>We have selected the Linux Foundation to advise us on the best way to structure and run the Foundation to ensure it is effective at growing, developing, and supporting the Node.js community via a neutral foundation. Given their track record with Linux and many other projects, we feel their expertise will be a real asset to the community.</p>
<h2>Joyent + Node.js</h2>
<p>Joyent will continue to be deeply involved with Node.js. Our business runs on Node.js, and so do our customers’. The contributions and support we offer in regards to Node.js will only grow as the project does. We’ll continue to dedicate multiple developers to full-time core development. As a large scale user of Node.js, we will contribute code, technical support, lessons-learned from our own experience, and other resources to develop the Node.js community.</p>
<p>I would like to thank not only the initial founding members and the Node.js Advisory Board members, but also thank the members of the community who help improve Node.js on a daily basis and have made it the success it is today. With their guidance and support, we’re confident that today marks a promising start to the next chapter of the Node.js story.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="videoWrapper" itemprop="video" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4mEzFDjqtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
<p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
<p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>
<p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</p>
<p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html#library-index"><em>The Python Standard Library</em></a>. <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html#reference-index"><em>The Python Language Reference</em></a> gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/extending/index.html#extending-index"><em>Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/index.html#c-api-index"><em>Python/C API Reference Manual</em></a>. There are also several books covering Python in depth.</p>
<p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html#library-index"><em>The Python Standard Library</em></a>.</p>

<p>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries.</p>
<p>Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there. The Sass Core Team has worked endlessly to not only keep up, but stay ahead.</p>
<p>Sass has been actively supported for over 8 years by its loving Core Team.</p>
<p>Over and over again, the industry is choosing Sass as the premier CSS extension language.</p>
<p>Sass is actively supported and developed by a consortium of several tech companies and hundreds of developers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.</p>
<p>Less runs inside Node, in the browser and inside Rhino. There are also many 3rd party tools that allow you to compile your files and watch for changes.</p>

<br />
What You Should ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
<hr />
<h4>What You Should Already Know</h4>
<p>Before you start studying jQuery, you should have a basic knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">Home page</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h4>What is jQuery?</h4>
<p>jQuery is a lightweight, &#8220;write less, do more&#8221;, JavaScript library.</p>
<p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
<p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
<p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
<li>CSS manipulation</li>
<li>HTML event methods</li>
<li>Effects and animations</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Why jQuery?</h4>
<p>There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.</p>
<p>Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
</ul>
<table id="table1" class="lamp">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/lamp.jpg" alt="Note" /></th>
<td><b>Will jQuery work in all browsers?<br />
</b><br />
The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer 6!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<section class="cta__description">In this course, we&#8217;ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, the programming language of the Web.</section>
<section class="cta__description"><strong><i>Javascript</i> </strong>is a scripting language produced by Netscape for use within HTML Web pages.</section>
<section class="cta__description"><em>JavaScript</em> is an object oriented dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax comes from the Java and C languages, so many structures from those languages apply to <em>JavaScript</em> as well. One of the key differences is that <em>JavaScript</em> does not have classes; instead, the class functionality is accomplished by object prototypes. The other main difference is that functions are objects, giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around like any other object.</section>
<section class="cta__description">This tutorial gives a complete understanding on <i>JavaScript</i>.</p>
<h4>Why Study JavaScript?</h4>
<p>JavaScript is one of the <strong>3 languages</strong> all web developers <strong>must</strong> learn:</p>
<p>1. <strong>HTML</strong> to define the content of web pages</p>
<p>2. <strong>CSS</strong> to specify the layout of web pages</p>
<p>3. <strong>JavaScript</strong> to program the behavior of web pages</p>
<p>This tutorial is about JavaScript, and how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><strong>Are you ready? Let&#8217;s get started!</strong></p>
