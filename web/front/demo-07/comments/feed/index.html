		<description><![CDATA[The overall structure of the course works well. I can tell that some thought was put into covering progressively more complex ideas. However, the instructor repeatedly forgets what he is doing. There is a lot of copy and paste with no explanation of the code.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really liked the projects that we did in this course. I think I have a good foundation to build on for future production apps. I think my one qualm would be that I was not expecting so much JavaScript and JQuery throughout the course. It was necessary, and it was definitely a good introduction, it was just a little overwhelming until I took a break from the projects and familiarized myself with JS and JQuery a bit before continuing - then it made a lot more sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very well structured course. I appreciate the clear introduction along with a summary at the end. Each chapter/project was well laid out and easy to follow along. I did have trouble a few times, but got a fairly quick response whenever I posted to the discussions. I had to figure a few things out on my own, but that&#039;s to be expected. The instructor isn&#039;t there to hold your hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was looking for a short tutorial to get me up and running with LESS. This course did just that with great examples and a simple webpage to create in the last section of the course. I was able to learn about LESS and found out about some resources to help me use it. The instructor was really good. It did take a moment to get used to how fast she was speaking. It was like the video was playing back faster than normal speed. It did not distract too much though. The production quality was great. The videos are in HD and the sound is high quality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a nice course to start with Sketch3. You just have to follow the instructions and you will learn a lot about Sketch3. I wasn&#039;t interested on the xCode implementation, so I don&#039;t care that the last sections were too short.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Eugen for this GA course, it has been really useful for me to understand basics of this fascinating world. Anyway I give you some kind advices to improve: 1) This course uses old version of GA and nowadays people who follows this course can not do the same at a real GA account. Options are slightly different now and it is quite tricky to follow and practice with it (although I managed to do it with my acccount !!!!!!). So I encourage you to do the same for the curren/latest GA version. It will be fantastic to attend one of your courses again. 2) I would remove the audio content of the course. It did not work at my side and we already have video + text versions, so it does not make sense to have it there. Sound files did not work at 2 different PCs, maybe something related with plugins or similar, but this type of course requires video to follow it and see real examples. Thanks a lot for this course.
